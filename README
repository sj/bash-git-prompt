Bashrc-git is a simple extension to Bash that shows useful information about
the Git repository in your current directory.

It consists of a single file (bashrc-git) which should be included in your
$HOME/.bashrc file. Suppose 'bashrc-git' is installed to
/home/bas/bashrc-git/bashrc-git, then edit /home/bas/.bashrc and add the
following at the very end:

source ~/bashrc-git/bashrc-git
