Bash-git-prompt is a simple extension to Bash that shows useful information at
the prompt about the Git repository in your current directory.

It consists of a file (bashrc-include) which should be included in your
$HOME/.bashrc file. Suppose bash-git-prompt is installed to
/home/bas/bash-git-prompt, then edit /home/bas/.bashrc and add the following at
the very end:

   source ~/bashrc-git/bash-git-prompt/bashrc-include


You can use the 'bash-git-prompt' command to change the behaviour of
bash-git-prompt. Just run it without parameters - it will inform you about the
usage instructions.
